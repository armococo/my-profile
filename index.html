						<h1>Hello everyone! </br> I am Armony and this is my website :)</h1>
			    		<img src="images/photo-de-profil.jpeg" alt="pdp">
			    		<p>I'm currently living in Cergy, where I'm studying a degree in Business Administration at ESSEC Business School. I like travelling, watching Netflix and fashion. </p>

						<h2>Travel</h2>
						<p>
							I love to travel. From a young age, I had the chance to discover many new horizons and today, the diversity of our region and its cultures fascinates me. Even when I feel like I know all the facets of a country, there is always a new place or a new element that comes to prove me wrong. <strong>That’s what I love, the infinity of landscapes and ways of living or thinking that exist. </strong>I would love to be able to say that I had the chance to see at least a part of every country in the world, and I will do everything to be able to say it.However, I rarely play soccer with my friends.

						<h2>Watching Netflix</h2>
						<p>
							I'm utterly captivated by the endless array of stories that Netflix offers. From gripping dramas to mind-bending thrillers, each series unlocks a new world of intrigue and imagination, making every binge-watching session an exhilarating escape into storytelling bliss.

						<h2>Fashion</h2>
						<p>
							Fashion is, in my opinion, a way of expressing ourselves without any limits. Indeed the diversity of possibilities and the multitasking of options or inspirations that exist allows each of us to find his account. The only thing that could prevent us from dressing as we wish is the gaze of others. Once this barrier is passed, fashion becomes our everyday bestfriend whether we decide to dress more « basic » or not. It evolves with us and changes with our age. So we might as well take advantage of our current desire and bring it to life at 100% instead of depriving ourselves of it!
